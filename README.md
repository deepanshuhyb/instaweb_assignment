## 🚀 **Drag-and-Drop Website Builder**

A React-based **drag-and-drop website builder prototype** that allows users to create website layouts by dragging elements like text, images, and buttons onto a predefined canvas. Users can also customize these elements using forms.

---

### 📌 **Features**

- **Drag-and-Drop Interface:**  
  Intuitive interface using `react-dnd` for moving elements onto a canvas.
- **Element Customization:**  
  Users can configure properties of each element through forms after placing them on the canvas.
- **Responsiveness:**  
  Works well across different devices (Desktop & Mobile).
- **Scalability:**  
  Modular architecture allowing for easy addition of more elements and features.
- **Modern Framework:**  
  Built with **React** for a fast and dynamic user experience.

### 📂 **Architecture**

- **React:** Core framework for building UI components.
- **react-dnd:** Library for handling drag-and-drop interactions.
- **HTML5Backend:** Backend for handling drag-and-drop in modern browsers.
- **State Management:** Managed using React's `useState` hook. Can be upgraded to `Zustand` or `Redux` for more complex features.
